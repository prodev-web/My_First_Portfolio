# My First Portfolio

Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my very first HTML project, part of an ongoing beginner web development journey. This project is all about learning the basics of HTML and building simple but meaningful web pages — from scratch, using only HTML (and a bit of creativity!).

---

## 🎯 What I’m Learning

By the end of this project, I should be able to explain — without Googling! — the following:

- What HTML is and how it works
- What a markup language is
- What tags, elements, and attributes are
- How browsers read and render HTML
- What the DOM is
- How to write and structure HTML properly

---

## 🛠 Tools & Rules

- I’m using **Visual Studio Code** (but any code editor works).
- Every file should end with a new line.
- I’m not using any frameworks or libraries (no Bootstrap, React, etc.).
- Everything has to be W3C valid — tested with the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- A `README.md` file like this one is required in the root of the project folder.

## 📁 Project Structure

### `/html_basic`

This folder contains simple HTML pages built step by step as I learn:

| Task # | File | What it does |
|--------|------|--------------|
| 0 | `base_index.html` | A super basic, valid HTML template |
| 1 | `index.html` | My first styled-up page with paragraphs, headings, and an image |
| 2 | `tweets.html` | Embeds a real tweet + links to the homepage |
| 3 | `index.html`, `tweets.html` | Adds consistent layout with a header, main, and footer |
| 4 | `index.html` | Adds a fun table with made-up learners (like John, Emily, etc.) |

### `/portfolio`

This is where I created a more complete and polished **Personal Portfolio** page, with proper structure and real-world sections you'd expect on a personal site.

#### It includes:

- A welcoming **header** with my name and a short tagline
- A working **navigation menu** to jump between sections
- A set of **sections** for:
  - **Introduction**
  - **Projects** (each one in its own `<article>`)
  - **About Me**
  - **Contact Info** (with email, LinkedIn, GitHub)
- A **footer** with copyright

## 👨‍💻 Example Table (Task 4)

In Task 4, I practiced creating a table using real HTML tags — no shortcuts or generators!

| Name    | Age | Country   |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| John    | 25  | USA       |
| Emily   | 28  | Canada    |
| Michael | 32  | Australia |
| Sophia  | 21  | UK        |

## 🚀 What I Can Do Now

Thanks to this project, I’m now able to:

- Build basic, clean HTML pages from scratch
- Write valid HTML that passes official checks
- Create page layouts using semantic HTML elements
- Link pages together for a mini-site experience
- Get ready to start learning CSS and JavaScript

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This is just the beginning! I'm building a strong foundation here, and everything I’ve learned will help me create more advanced websites in the future. If you’re also starting out — keep going, the small wins add up!

Thanks for checking out my work 🙌
